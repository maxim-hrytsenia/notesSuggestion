# Notes Suggestion

The amount of information is growing every day. It is almost impossible to catch up with all interesting links and books 
that are deserved to be read. The Notes Suggestion is a tool that is dedicated to solve this problem for 
you. 

Use the website to create an account and add links to articles and books that you want to read. Additionally provide
the information about the importance of the information source for you. Our tool would automatically estimate the amount 
of needed time to read an article for you and provide you the most important articles every day that can fit your time.
As soon as you finish reading, just mark the article as read and whether you want to read it again later.
